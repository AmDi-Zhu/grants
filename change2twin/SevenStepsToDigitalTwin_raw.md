## DT

like i said it's a little bit stand alone so the digital twinning seven steps to digitals how do we do that and what do we mean with this

## Start with why (DT at the heart of tomorrow's systems)

and like i said going a little bit easy as a reminder we start with the why and already when you look at these examples here areas in which we work actually you see that why might of course be very very different on the one hand side we are talking about these digital twins that are at the heart of tomorrow's systems we are talking about smart buildings we are talking about maybe indeed sea firing vessels which have extreme situations which they have to handle we talk about the smart industry with the example here of asmr close to me and eindhoven or the port of rotterdam the protection of critical infrastructures which digital twins where you have a resilience problem where you say i go from prevention preparation response and recovery for basically everything which is sensibly expecting to happen just to say that this infrastructure has to work and obviously this problem of protecting the port of rotterdam against flooding a disaster whatever is very different from a smart building here with the examples of significant former philips lighting division um building a smart lighting system in the edge building and basically reducing your energy bill


## Start with why (DT in the manufacturing industry)

So, in that sense, for the most of us, these areas will actually be less important than maybe this one in the area of the manufacturing  industry. But also there, we still see that the "why" of the digital  twin is extremely wide. It could be about smart logistics, adaptive  just-in-time, having a fitting inventory to the task at hand. It could  be about the scheduling on the factory floor, about the monitoring of  the equipment. There, really, that you say, less consumption,  sustainable, and optimization, reducing waste, all these things. But it  could also be about model-based control, flexible manufacturing,  made-to-order. That you have slot sizes of one and a little change-over  efforts between production ones. That the programming of the machines is low-code, no-code. And that you actually say, "Okay, this is with the  digital twin maybe several times faster than it was before." And of  course, very often it's about preventive maintenance, downtime  prevention. That no machine which is in the critical parts here for this production ever goes down in an unscheduled way. Of course, maintenance will be needed, but not as an emergency response. That is, of course,  something we are after.

## Start with why (DT are not free but offera large return of investment)

now with all of these digital twins we know that they are not free it is an effort to build something like that and even if i contradict at least um one of the speakers of yesterday um we don't believe that it is always that easy you have to have a little bit of technical knowledge here you have to invest time you really have to know what you want so the why starting with the why is critical but also the technical expertise to do it to make key decisions yourself in a company so if you advise the company then of course it's a digital innovation happy needs a technical expertise to also tell them what decision making in the company will actually mean so that they are also confident that they own the decision that this is not blindly following but that this is actually something where they say okay i get it this is what i can do in this call so that is then where you say okay because i understand i can do this investment and the return of investment for the digital twins if done right is normally a large one i give you some examples here consumption numbers going down 10 to 30 percent fuel for vessels for example on energy bills this is significant so a business model of phillips here for example is indeed to say you don't pay us but we get the money that you're saving energy so they are that confident in earning it back that they can make a business offer like that preventive maintenance very often has a return of investment in the first year which was already over a hundred percent so this is an area where taking the step towards the difference between pays off but you have to do it right

## The why (Is entitled to its own rationale)

and starting with the why is the right thing to do and that is why we said it is entitled to its own rationale the why is so important that you really have to get it and this is why we developed the change tutoring compass tool allow her explain all of that to you so you know it however i'm taking it over from here the y connects your business and the kpi is that you are describing in this analysis which is the digit between purpose now here in gray on the lower side of the slide you actually see these kpis so we have many in this tooling um in the in the compass tool uh which basically then say in the analysis you know that certain items are of critical importance to that company so from there on the y analysis basically says okay then these are the purposes of digital twins which should be pursued here so for example if downtime should be reduced to an unscheduled downtime zero then obviously preventive maintenance diagnosis and these areas are critical to you if on the other hand it's about the consumption of energy well when it's monitoring and optimization which of course also goes in the direction of best quality you just optimize for a different goal but of course it might be also something very very different like customer engagement virtual design commissioning so the first steps of installing a system on a site all of these things different kpis different why different purpose and that is something where we start with today

## Purposes differ greatly

so when we say these purposes differ greatly and then we basically structured it in a set of typical purposes the first four you see here so the virtual design is basically when the digital comes first into being so that this is really about all the places where they say okay i want to know what the system will be i want to design it in the right way i want validation before i build it all of these things and this is actually one of the areas where my own organization easy is very strong and that we say okay this building of systems in a structured way the system engineering part of the full chain this is our art and science but of course you can immediately go further from that you can say okay customer engagement the customer should see what they will get and you have seen unit 40 yesterday um i would say they excellent that so you understand what will be there which of course means you might have already something virtual which you can use for training but it might also be the decision that a customer says yes this is what i want to buy so if you have something like a flexible product where you say there's a lot of customization going on a lot of options for the customer to choose but it will be costly to change it later on then of course this is what you do virtualization together with customer engagement the customer sees what they will get then comes the commissioning step so first time honest first time right this is something which you have definitely in areas like the smart buildings where you say you have an awful lot of sensors and all of them have their id numbers and they have their mappings where you have to so okay this sensor is here and it's connected to that gateway and then it's doing this functionality and of course it goes wrong and a digit between of course helps here say okay we really want it in an orderly fashion we do it step by step we know exactly if it's correct and when we switch it on we will not spend the next week hunting bucks in this installation looking for flipped cables or something like this but they are also very different purposes like feedback to engineering so you have the machines in the field it's your product it's running somewhere and now you want to know something about it maybe you want to know why a certain machine fails more often than another maybe you want to learn how it's typically used to do the next iteration the next generation of the systems more suited to the needs in the field maybe you want to estimate risks in in safety critical areas where you actually say okay what do i need to protect myself against all of these areas are something which is really a feedback loop towards the own engineers of and company and also that is of course supported by a digital twin

## Purposes differ greatly (as do needs)

now when we look at these areas we can immediately see that the needs for the digital twin will also differ greatly so if i just give you some nice examples here customer engagement upper right our virtual design are indeed more like a drawing upper left but also let's say feedback to engineering really seeing the effect of for example heat isolation by measurements outside the lab and just generating the data or commissioning models which basically say okay uh i'm basically simulating what i should see i can see that i observe something different and i can immediately say what must be wrong all of these things are possible and all of these things means this is a different digital twin and of course it is possible to imagine that there is a core of this digital twin which says i'm the same and then i have extensions towards certain purposes certain user interfaces for different people commissioning is done by other people than the feedback to engineering obviously so it is possible to imagine that it's one digit between which has different aspects but we can also for the sake of simplicity just say no these are different digital twins and we are building something different here and it will look different so the needs will be different

## Purposes differ greatly (When ...)

now the story goes on so let me give you the list basically of the purposes we will investigating a little bit today so the next one is basically when you say in operations the fast response is essential so monitoring optimization best quality problems get your link this is this area especially for everything where you have that smart in the name the smart building the smart factory and stuff like that and you will remember that my colleague you roon uh told you that digital twins are very much about the decision they support decision making i think this is where it's very clearly seen they support it because they notify you something is going on you a human need to respond or if they go a little bit higher but that is a smart system they actually say okay i can handle this now the picture in the middle is something in the area of preventive maintenance that i compare one system the red line in this picture to other symptoms i have seen in the past and actually say okay um this is how the performance is degrading i have seen this before therefore i'm predicting a breakdown in that in the time span which of course gives me the opportunity to schedule my maintenance earlier than that now next to that of course we have the smart systems themselves when they say okay they adapt control so this is the area where the system starts to analyze starts to plan and then executes an action and changes something based on the computations in the d223 so this is far beyond monitoring this is far beyond giving you a picture of what is going on this is decision taking by the digital train now you can imagine that some people will say hey this is where the ai technology goes in this is where the smart system is where all the fancy stuff happens you will also find some people who say well you know come on this is control we have done this for decades so what is the difference here and that gets to be very technical to say whether or not there is a dividing line in between i think this is actually not important for us here the fact is that basically the digital twin takes information that we would see on the slide on the left side and says okay the analysis and the planning is done in the computer and the computer takes a decision the digital twin is computing and not only showing and then it takes an action 

## Physical and digital twin connect

so with this i can basically say okay if we know that what is still the same thing in all of these areas and of course you have learned that yesterday they did it between mirror aspects of real systems processes or products so i'm showing you one example here which is in the area of juventus maintenance and actually um atlas cospo is one of the companies or a very very nice flagship story about how to build something like this uh but it's only an illustration it will always be looking the same the ultimate goal here is to connect the digit between two data fields so that the digital twin can monitor it can assess and maybe predict of what is going on but that will not be enough you need the integration with business processes so in the area of preventive maintenance i think this becomes immediately obvious if the digital twin tells you that this system is on a decline that it performance gets more lousy and more lousy and more lousy so that in five days if things continue like that it will not fulfill its function any longer and within 10 days it will most likely break you know that a service team has to take an action the digital twin is not going to do that therefore the integration with business processes is obviously the crucial item here so someone who tells you i will build you the digital twin well that still means that the company who has the deleted twin has some work to do here and that needs to fit and all of that is indeed in the seven step stone

## We build a roadmap: the 7-steps (but the journey is not the same for everyone)

so this is why we built a roadmap the stepping steps that we say okay we have a certain blueprint because there are similarities but the journey to do so is definitely not the same for everyone so even though i could tell it here for a single example and you would see this this is how you do it i still urge you to understand from the point of view especially of the digital innovation hacks if you give advice it is not the same for everyone very strongly of course you see this in the part that digitally effort digitalization efforts could be part of a large transformation you could indeed say hey this company is going into a new market with smart products they never did something like this before so this is a major change or it could be that you just just say the company wants to avoid waste and they have chosen the digital twin technology for monitoring to do this better so it becomes more sustainable they are responding maybe to a requirement by law but in essence they want to do the business they always did but they make it more sustainable so that will not be the same game but in the same manner the starting point is also very different between companies there will be companies where i go and say okay what do you have do you have for example engineering models of the systems that you want to monitor if so it might be an easy transformation a relatively easy transformation to go to a digital between monitoring them because you have all the understanding of how this system works in a computable readable form or you might say no green field this is about the next generation and i never did anything in a digital way so let's start with everything from virtual design towards the digital train with nothing in legacy with nothing which i have to consider just rolling out the best possible way for the future so very different starting point very different approach but another thing is the journey has its own needs too and the digital innovation hubs they will differ here some of you i assume will actually offer very technical advice some others will look into business processes more strongly and some others might actually have a strong angle for change management as well innovation normally means change and with change you are on a journey that journey has its own needs i give you some of them here it's basically the management is all in if management is not supporting that and normally the journey fails communication obviously open and directional people listening competence for decisions in-house now the digital innovation hubs support the digital innovation helps advice but in the end it has to be someone who says i'm going to do this i'm going to sign this and at least that inner gut feeling of i'm confident because i understand enough or that feeling of oh wow ah this is so complicated i cannot sleep uh so this is now that i know i need to learn more um that kind of competence for in-house decision doesn't mean every technical detail you can outsource that that is what the innovation have with the marketplace is for but decisions are taken by people in the companies they have to be familiar enough with this then of course you do it for the end user and you do it with them and this is the twin which is showing information and the management looks at this and says this is a beautiful picture and then the service people say yeah but it's not showing what i need for preventive maintenance 

that is a failure so with the end user what are their needs how are they thinking what can they cope with that kind of story and then indeed it is about change so help everyone involved digitalization like this digital twins might very well mean that some people fear for their jobs that some people say i'm going to be left behind this is new computer fancy stuff i don't even have a pc at home what are you talking about i don't want this so it's a company's responsibility to say guys we are doing this together there is training and then of course the digital innovation hubs can also offer support in this but help everyone on board make that clear to the customers of the digital innovation hubs it's a journey and a journey has its own needs so you they have to think about this

## Realizing digital twins in seven steps (1)

we actually wrote this down so this picture on the left here the ready for digital twins that's a nice flyer i think it has a nice level of abstraction here it basically doesn't assume too much it starts with um with explaining what all of this is about and what i just spoke about basically this intro which i now gave you a little bit on paper format it explains this seven steps method which we are following here so in that sense it's a little bit of easy reading and i advise you to use it um and actually the seven steps are listed here on the right and we definitely talked about to start with the y enough so i will not go into that any further but basically run through these seven steps now for the reminder of the presentation and in that way tell you a little bit about how to approach it 

## Asset selection:: the physical twin (2)

and the first one for this is actually the asset selection now the asset selection is about the physical training and like i said before digital twin mirrors aspects of real system processes or products so this is a choice so even when i say i'm staying in this example of manufacturing i could narrow the logistic chain the shop for processes the machines on that factory floor or i could mirror the product and say this is about the control of the machine which has to be digital uh but the twin is about the product so what do i choose which asset is the one that i want to mirror and from that asset which aspects are essential even if i twin a machine do i do this for the purpose of maintenance or do i do this for the purpose of control or do i do it for those so that's a decision so asset selection the physical trick that is basically the first step

## Realizing digital twins (3,4)

and after that we are already going into the realization of the digital tree so now we know what our physical twin is and we want to start building we have two aspects in this and these are the steps three and four the infrastructure and between building the infrastructure is about the data flowing from the physical trend towards the digital so bringing the sensors life enabling information flows so here we see terms like iot the internet of things so basically the technology which is readily available to connect from sensor towards the data distribution maybe connect to databases merge it with other information so this is where the term cyber physical comes in maybe you will find oh wait a second i actually need to share data with some other people to be most effective so then i have to talk about trust and maybe protecting my data sharing so all of that is is an area which is to be considered and so you see here this nice picture and when i say it is to be considered you already realize we have a choice here trusted data sharing might not be necessary the cyber physical connection to other databases might not be necessary but if it's a two-digited twin having live sensors and having a data chain from the live sensors to the digital twin is essential 

so this is the area where you say okay some of these parts you will need and some others you might need and remember when i said that this is about consultancy that this is about understanding of needs given a purpose and mapping them towards technical options this is where the consultancy comes in to make that mapping so in that sense when i say here these are five major items in the area of infrastructure and data transport and my statement is they have to be considered if they are needed and the answer can easily be no and if the answer is yes well then let's look into it same with the data also the world from the physical to the literature so here you see the terms like the virtualization but also failure modes and effect and criticality analysis the link between data and knowledge so basically knowing that hey i have some models about my digit about my physical thing so this is what describes the physical object in the computer this is the digital twin but that sensor over here that is actually providing data for that part of the model so really understanding this mapping it is uh certainly not often that straightforward this is part of it understanding what happens if something goes wrong in the system so that you can interpret the virtualization itself of course but also some other items which are sometimes overlooked here so this is why we like to have all these boxes on the paper the one is to ensure fidelity ensure trust a running digital twin is a system so tweet it accordingly if there's a company building system they of course understand that they have to have quality control that they have to have test runs and so on and so on and so on same here so if you're building a digital twin with someone for someone if you're helping them plan accordingly and understand that the first goal of the digital twin might still have some hiccups bugs things you didn't think of therefore you test it you get user feedback you revise it you make it ready and then it works 

and more importantly see to it that people have a reason to trust it so the big black box where then someone stands in front of and says yes is brewing up the information that i should do a maintenance now and i don't understand how it's doing that and i don't understand why it's telling me that i'm standing in front of the machine and the machine looks fine too no trust no action because of that lack of trust the service guy might simply say you know i'm not opening this this is running so stepping away and then it breaks down a week later and he says okay you were right but i still don't get it why so i don't trust so in that sense ensure the fidelity but do it in a way that the people using the digital twin understand yes this is what is happening inside this is why i can trust it and that doesn't mean that they have to understand every detail but enough to trust another area here by the way is then configuration management so we have many customers in the high tech domain and there is this one mode that the only constant for them of course is change there are software updates to the machines there are maintenance operations the situation changes and stuff like that so i have data over a certain machine and i'm looking at the machine right now i say that doesn't make sense i'm seeing a timeline for data here but actually there is no sensor producing that data how can that be then someone tells me oh yeah we changed the software so this is no longer captured oh great so you are telling me that i'm looking at data which doesn't apply any longer for the machine i'm looking at so i need to know the configuration of the machine so that i can configure the digital twin in the same way so configuration management also one of the items often overlooked has to be taken into account

## Operating digital twins (5,6)

now with that we can finally say we have a digital twin and i can finally drink something so operating the digital between life operation and business action steps five and six in the seven steps now the digital twin is supposed to be always on and always in sync but what does it do now our advice here for example is that there are certain parts of the digital twin which really should run autonomously especially everything about detection so if for example there is an anomaly you're monitoring something and out of the sudden the numbers really don't look normal any longer you want this digital twin to notify you you do not want the situation that once in a day someone looks at the data and then he might notice this and this thinking of course is something that everyone running machines is used to this is about process control that you are saying hey there's a certain bandwidth of fluctuation in my sensor readings which i'm willing to accept and everything beyond that is so unlikely that i want a human to think whether or not we need to respond and to change something so this is where areas like the western electric rules player role in every expert will know that change detection anomaly detection based on life monitoring and then enabling process control this is a well understood chain now the reasoning on okay what did just happen why do we see these numbers is this a problem or a glitch was this just unlikely or is this now something which really goes wrong and need an in that response that is the area of reasoning a root cause analysis is now this why question that is something that doesn't need to happen autonomously that is something i can do on demand after i was notified that something is going on but that is a design decision so you have to think about what is needed here what are the response times needed for that and all of that and then you build a calling similar of course with the point of prediction 

so yes if i have data coming in from the physical system to my digital between and the digital twin says okay this is a nice curve then of course we have algorithms these days that just say okay then most likely this curve will go down like this and it will hit rock bottom within seven days and this can be very simple it can be very elaborate with knowledge about the building blocks in your systems and everything but prediction is possible so what will happen in the future but then again how often do you do this who picks it up this is again a question of the design of the digit between but also of the business actions so in that sense everyone has to understand that they need to be ready to read the benefits here that they have to have business processes that consume the information and i already gave you the example of the predictive maintenance that it doesn't matter if the digital twin knew that the breakdown would happen if no service team responds to it so a process that the company then might establish and saying you know when the service department opens up the computers in the morning they get a report and the report tells them we are flagging six machines in the field now as please take an action so start scheduling stuff like that that is a business process it can be that simple but someone has to have it so the process that consumes the information that the digital twin provides has to be in place and then assess your success so digital between once numbers are generated service department takes action was this always in time or was this hit and miss 

do we in the end find that the digital twin is internally seemingly warning dice and maybe has an one in five hit weight and missing too many machines which it should have been predicted that they needed service but didn't or is this a system which is that on occurred and basically saying no i know everything which is going on here so as test that think about success criteria build them in and basically have now and then every vision of the success of the digital twin and whether or not just like with any other running system it might need an update

## Operating digital twins (5,6) 2

the interweaving of the live operations and the business action is by the way also pretty interesting one if you use this picture here which is by the way the map key so monitoring analyzing planning and execution so in that sense when you think about it does it tell you something about how to build the digital twin and we believe it does it will often be seen in a way that yes i'm giving you the digital tree and now you have to do your business accordingly but think about it this is actually not smart if for example your service department says you know my machines in the field are all over the world and we cannot afford a service organization which has people all over the world which means if you notify me i have to get there together with all the right parts and that takes four days well then the digital twin better announces the need for service something like seven days in advance and not three days because then it is no longer possible to prevent the breakdown in time so it's the business action in this case which says you have to be on that deadline you have to have that four cars then we are successful and not the life operation that the technical guy says yes i built it and i believe it has a 90 percent accuracy on three days but only 60 accuracy on seven days no then you have to do better change the digital twin because changing the business process so that it can respond to three days is by far too costly so they are interwoven but the business action might be the one leading the requirements for the live operation

## Change happens (7)

so this is also something to understand here and in terms of that things change which i already mentioned just realize change happens so this is cradle to grave thinking keep it alive keep it useful step seven of the seven steps method so there's this notion of a digital thread that reads the traceability of the digitalization and the system from credit to grades meaning that these items which i mentioned earlier data collected at one point in time system description for another point in time things don't match that kind of stuff here so that you know sooner or later this system will change the digital twin has to change accordingly or you find a bug in the digital twin now it gives different advice you have to understand that for example the analysis of your success rate changed at that point in time and stuff like that so this is another step which we often seem to be overlooked so change happens and tell everyone that this is something which will continue you build it once you put your effort there the better you are in that moment the less work you will have over time but you will have work later on so this is not something where you go to a vendor and then say yeah install it and then get out of my company and i never need to see you again and i don't have the competence in-house to touch it 

so i will just trust it for the rest of my life it will not work like this but there's a benefit if you do it like this you're also solving a very very strong problem in areas where systems run for a long time and that is the knowledge management especially people looking at infrastructure systems they face that that they say okay we built this 30 years ago we updated it 20 years ago then we did a minor extension 10 years ago and now the customer comes back and says they need another extension but they also want a new update at the same time and actually whoever knew what the system is doing is in retirement oops because we cannot even find the files so we have no clue what is going on now this credit to grave thinking with a digital twin is actually addressing that problem you really say i'm bringing together the information over time and i know what happened over time to my system so i also know in which state it is now what is the software now which parts are in there now and all of that so knowledge management over time to keep your systems running as well as between so that is addressed in step number seven

## Digital twin: core activities

and with this i basically gave you the whole list and i'm also giving you now for the first time the picture of the core activities of this seven steps message so nicely arranged or not so nicely depending on how you look at it i like it um they are a little bit color coded in this picture you also have this umbrella of purposes around it and they are roughly placed in this right area so that you know okay customer engagement virtual design these things are lower left and optimization monitoring is upper right things like that but basically the message here is hey this is a set of activities that we are looking at when we are building a digital tool

## Change2twin support for DIH

and with this i introduce the next concepts that i say okay now you have seen the core activities for the seven steps method so let's talk about pathways pathways are basically a notion that for a certain purpose you need a certain part a certain path in that graph so these are the required competencies of the company building the digital twin and this is of course also what opens the door to this readiness assessment this is the point where i say okay if i look at this company and i basically say this is what they have and i do understand what is required i can do the delta analysis and if i have a delta if i say you are not ready to do this well then i know in which areas i need an uplift in which areas i can direct you to the change between marketplace for example and tell you yeah there is someone who is selling this so you can ask them or they are someone who's offering training in this area so train your people and then you are there and then you can do it

## Digital twinning 7-steps pathways

so in that sense um we are going into these pathways now for the remaining of this presentation and then we take our break

## Pathways:: dedicated core activity sets

so the pathways are basically the notion that given a starting point purpose and goals i'm expressing the needs remember again this is the consultancy part so this is y2ict you could argue and i'm giving you one example here optimization monitoring and you see that i grade out many many areas of this so basically saying it might be that simple so i gave you a big picture it might be scary one saying whoa i have to do all of that no no no no no wait a second you want a simple digital twin you don't but you will have to have life operations you will have to have live sensors and they need to connect so this blue line for example is absolutely essential no way around it if you want to do an optimization process this one's concurrently no way around it you have to have that so this is the notion a dedicated set of core activities for a certain purpose

## Pathway:: smart systems

now let me give you some examples smart systems now this is the big one adaptive control based on live data so the inner digital twin now is part of the system and the process is alive there's no human in the loop and you see this is basically the full picture there's very few blocks missing here so the pathway for smart systems is a large one

## Pathway:: on the way to a product 

https://youtu.be/8jOqF3v6Se8?t=2734

![image-20230314163214764](media/image-20230314163214764.png)

now if we are just on the way to a product so when the digital domain comes first into being this is model based system engineering this is virtual design this is a simulation and analysis when you are engaging to the customer at the same time customer but solutions experience value and use beforehand this is another part of the story but in both cases the pathway to success is a very very small one you might go into great details here but you don't not need live operations life monitoring data all of that no you do it on that side it's fine

## Pathway:: bringing the system online 

https://youtu.be/8jOqF3v6Se8?t=2779

![image-20230314163224837](media/image-20230314163224837.png)

now the pathways of bringing systems online the challenge of commissioning especially important in either large installations or in installations where you say this is very fine-tuned configuration fitting to the environment a lot of parameters in my system which really need to fit to the place where i install it so this first time on is first time right um that is the commissioning problem and so here it's very important that on the one inside we have a match between the physical and the digital twin and we look into the fitness of the physical to its purpose so this is a verification and validation process or a life monitoring process where you bring it online step by step and you just check against steps but in that sense the pathway of course has many parts already inside we need the virtual part we need the live feed but things like process control change detections and all of that not there because it's not running yet you are still building it up but you might want to have that root cause analysis which wasn't present in the earlier picture because if something is not fitting if you do detect the anomaly and you say no this is not how i specified the system i actually want to find out where did i go wrong and you have that part 

## Pathway:: understanding the install base 

so another pathway is the understanding of the install base the feedback towards engineering so here you see that the right side gets a little bit more stronger so dedicated analysis of an inner issue but maybe in concert with understanding usage patterns and their effects so if someone is constantly switching the equipment on and off and by that they are using it in a different way and they are wearing something out more strongly that is something that you want to understand here maybe effects due to configuration hey this special piece of my uh configuration is absolutely fine and that one is also absolutely fine but the moment someone builds a system with both of them at the same time things start to break that kind of understanding so that you can improvement that you can do improvements or maybe understand what the next generation of needs is this is where other parts now of the digital tutoring is rising important so out of a sudden as this usage profiling you have fleet analytics these building blocks which are otherwise not necessarily relevant

## Pathway:: live processes

another pathway which we already handled is of course the one for the life processes this is what i spoke about earlier in detail when a fast response is essential so live view on ongoing processes control based on life data alerts on issues and events of interest so the area of scheduling optimization monitoring that you detect something requires an action has this pathway

## Pathway:: guaranteed availability

and then we have the one for the guaranteed availability so especially this area when the unscheduled downtime is a big no minimal service times with no breakdowns everything at the right place on time if you have to do a service action so nothing like a secondary visit service guy comes there and says yeah i understand what's wrong but i don't have the parts a non-acceptable message here so prediction of needed parts of needed actions of the immediate expertise of the service teams so that of course means understanding causes and effects so this is why the pathway now goes into this area of root cause analysis but also on prediction so that this information comes in time

## Digital twinning 7-steps readiness

and with this the pathways themselves are done to the understanding and like i said earlier there's detailed information on that available but let me finish this part of my presentation um with those readiness thinking 

## 7-steps ready for digital twin assessment

so because if we do have this area here that we say the seven steps we want to understand now how ready a company is we basically want to say in each of these areas how good are you now we streamlined this experience a little bit so instead of saying we want you to ask a company a set of questions for all of these individual shapes we are basically saying no 10 sections and you see them here so like life sensors which is the light blue or the twin fidelity which is the yellow one for these ten sections and cultures we basically want to access the readiness of a company and then we also have the pathways for the main purposes and then we can do it within the tooling and already set assessment of course you can always do a more detailed assessment by a safety consultant that is always an option so you can say this customer really needs to understand a certain part of this graph in detail so we will look into this maybe also because in a certain innovation app you really have the expertise to go deep into something and you really want to offer something here absolutely fine but based on the tooling that we offer right now we streamline this a little bit so we are talking about these sections which you see highlighted here

## 7-steps ready for digital twin assessment (Delta anlysis)

and then the idea is like this we are matching the readiness levels we have the requirements to succeed and we're doing the delta analysis with the assessment of the readiness level of a so we might for example say okay uh there's a set of numbers popping up in these boxes and there's a set of numbers popping up for the pathways that we believe we need and we just say hey wherever you are lower you have to do something in that sense that's simple we are already always using six comparable levels so zero absolutely nothing spx absolutely everything is there which is imaginable and very often you will not need the six

## 7-steps assessment:: readiness levels

and these levels um they are based on these digitalization levels which were developed for the smart industry and you have also seen this picture yesterday already so the questions we asking the informations we are after is always similar to this so we are following this but of course this is an overview picture here and the moment you go into a detailed picture you can ask the questions more specifically but still in terms of these levels we basically say we are following this idea from there is nothing towards everything is already automated live and an adaptive way

## 7-steps assessment:: readiness levels (2)

so we see that there's a certain let's say order of things here where you say you can understand that that in the top two if someone is in that area they are just not there yet they really can't do a digital twin with just having some digital documents but no digital processes whatsoever but the moment you go to the level two and three we are in the area where you say okay connected information digital processes maybe already the live data view level three this is where training starts and but this kind of twinning only gives you awareness and then a human in the loop acts with level 4 we are talking about twins where the digital processes that consume live data come into place so automation becomes possible so response recent business authoring processes so meaning it could be that the service process is automatically triggered by the twin but then still the humans do it but it could also be that the tween itself is already taking actions filling out order forms or whatever because it just knows what parts will be needed and things like this 

## 7-steps assessment:: attention points

so levels four five six are the area where automation becomes possible digital processes that consume live data in place they might become predictive this is then the next level number five or even fully automated that change operations so the area of the twin which takes decisions that is then level six and so we always follow the idea of six levels like this so when you do an assessment following these ideas there are a few attention points which i want to uh announce now so first you can imagine when we are talking about all these different parts of the graph from data to business processes and so on you see that the interview might need replies from several stakeholders now it's absolutely possible that there's a small as an er e that says no we do have a ceo who is in every bits and detail of our company he can answer that all absolutely fine it's possible of course however it might also be that that ceo says okay you know i did the business analysis with you yesterday uh with this great tool from laura but these kind of questions i have no clue so now i'm calling in my lead people for these areas and you all get half an hour with them because that's all it takes and then the interview is over in that way another attention point we observe a trend to over estimations in self-assessments so principally speaking um this could be done without a consultant you could just say okay um hey these are example areas what do you think where are you um now people like your roon our own experience consultants they find hey if i look at this i would have given you a lower number 

so in that sense we caution everyone against an overestimation here take it with a grain of salt and maybe err on the cautious side a little bit on the other hand in this assessment we check against the minimal readiness level to succeed that is not the statement that having more would not be better so you can easily imagine that there is a point where you say now i have a running digital twin and it's running on that in that level but for example it's just showing what is this there now it did not make the step from four to five it did not go too predictive now if it would the business success might actually be far greater but it is a success already on level 4. so in that sense the check we are proposing here is against the minimum readiness level so whenever our cheque says you are not there we really believe no the company needs to make a step but as a consultant in the digital innovation hub i still say the level for optimal benefits is often one higher normally only one so still think about it so just the fact that we give you a nice presentation and a tool and everything would never ever mean you stop thinking so that is the point where people come in experts come in and i believe this is the game the digital innovation hubs play best so i wish you best success with that

## Further information

um we will take a break now and then we will actually see the tool a little bit and then i also give you the more detailed information um so if there are questions so i'm the one here on top um here aboard so of course you can get in touch with me if there are questions um i'm working for easy this is a subdivision a joint innovation center under the umbrella of tmo and when you go to our website so easy and health for example you can also easily find more information what we think about it but remember we are a research innovation center um not a general innovation hub however uh you roon uh of course you get to know him yesterday he is a consultant of us in the area of ict so the process of doing consultancy with this work is something where he can give excellent advice upon um but in terms of material and i will show it to you after a short break here and we still basically have three things now on the one inside we have the tool itself 

so similar to what laura showed you yesterday an assessment tool next to that there are two presentations here the assessment presentation and the pathway presentation they have a different content and i will show it to you a little bit um later so there is the last part here of my time slot where i show you basically which material is available to you but the idea here is that the pathway presentation explains to you our thinking about the numbers on these pathways so the moment you say you are assessing a company and you have the feeling that none of the pathways that we already prepared is suitable for that company they want a different digital twin this is basically this statement you're making they are more unique than our pre-compiled cases then you're working on that level of that pathways um you are finding out new numbers of what these guys might need now the other presentation the seven steps assessment presentation that is the one that basically tells you this is the kind of concern which is in that area so when you're assessing this this is the kind of topic you are talking about and this is the kind of question you are asking to assess if someone is on that level or not and i will show you that a little bit and it makes perfect sense for example to have the assessment presentation open while you're asking question and then filling in the answers in the tool so just as a way of working but if you need other numbers the pathway presentation gives you some pointers from that one and with this allow me to call a break um so i talk for an hour
