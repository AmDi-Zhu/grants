Переклад оригіналу [FIRST REPORT ON STANDARDS RELEVANT FOR DIGITAL TWINS](https://www.change2twin.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1.2-First-report-on-standards-relevant-for-digital-twins.pdf)

## 1 DOCUMENT SCOPE

Використання стандартів є важливим для цифрових двійників. Стандарти допомагають подолати бар’єри для цифрових двійників, наприклад той, що називається «[BAR-T5] Об’єднання всього разом» у Change2Twin [D1.1 «Бар’єри для цифрових двійників»](https://www.change2twin.eu/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/D1.1-Digital-Twin-Barriers.pdf). Сумісність апаратного забезпечення, програмного забезпечення та даних із гетерогенного середовища є одним із важливих прикладів, який потребує широко визнаних і перевірених домовленостей. Особливо малі та середні підприємства (МСП) через свої обмежені ресурси отримують велику користь від існування стандартів. Проте існування документів у чистому вигляді недостатньо, і їх потрібно поєднувати з посібниками з найкращої практики та підтримкою стандартів на ринку.

Change2Twin розглядає стандарти як забезпечувальну (enabling) технологію. Ось чому Завдання 1.5 «Зв’язок між різними стандартами» є частиною робочого пакету 1 «Забезпечувальні технології для цифрових двійників» разом з іншими технологіями для цифрових двійників, такими як зв’язок, безпека, якість, взаємодія з користувачем/ергономіка та інженерія . Стандарти полегшують використання передових технологій у цифрових двійниках. Як і інші технології, стандарти необхідно розробляти, перевіряти та підтримувати; це входить до завдання 1.5. Наша діяльність включає перегляд стандартів, рекомендації користувачам і відгуки до органів стандартизації. Наші результати підтримають, серед іншого, надання можливості постачальникам технологій у Завданні 1.3 «Адаптація технологій постачальників рішень для більш загального підходу» покращити свою конкурентоспроможність на ринку.

Цей звіт D1.2 «Перший звіт щодо стандартів, які стосуються цифрових  двійників», представляє початковий аналіз відповідних стандартів на  основі опитувань, що були опубліковані іншими проектами та  організаціями, а також на основі внеску партнерів Change2Twin (C2T).  Редакційна команда зібрала стандарти, які можуть бути відповідними для  рішень Change2Twin з метою представлення широкого спектру стандартів  проекту. Партнери проекту визначили стандарти, які є важливими для  їхнього внеску в рішення щодо цифрових двійників. Вони вказали, як вони  будуть працювати над розробкою цих стандартів протягом періоду проекту.

Цей документ адресований громадській аудиторії наступних типів читачів:

- Розробники стандартів цифрових двійників,
- Розробники цифрових рішень зі створення цифрових двійників,
- Люди з робочим досвідом складних системних архітектур та рішень в галузі інформаційно-комунікаційних технологій.

Розділ 3 дає огляд органів стандартизації, які розробляють стандарти для цифрових двійників і інтелектуального виробництва.

Розділ 4 представляє опитування, які інші проекти та організації проводили для визначення таких стандартів і які були враховані як корисний внесок у цей звіт.

У розділі 5 партнери C2T зобов'язуються використовувати стандарти для аспектів цифрових двійників, які вони підтримують. Висвітлені ролі стандартів у досягненні цілей C2T .

У розділі 6 наводиться висновок звіту та перспективні активності до другого звіту про стандарти в травні 2022 року.

Крім того, Додаток А містить найбільш повний список відповідних стандартів, який проект зміг знайти, доповнений стандартами, які Консорціум C2T вважає важливими. Список також вказує типи залучення партнерів C2T до перелічених елементів, тобто, чи вони використовують, моніторять або розробляють ці стандарти.

## 3 STANDARDISATION BODIES FOR DIGITAL TWINS

Some standards for digital twins support the infrastructure of a digital twin implementation; they may be categorized as generally applicable. They concern matters of reference architectures, the Internet of Things, hardware interfaces, low level network protocols including cloud communication, data interoperability (low level), data archival, data security including blockchain, data quality, sensors, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and many more.

Other standards are domain specific. Their applicability depends on the purpose of a digital twin, which may be manufacturing or predictive maintenance for example. Such domain specific standards address processes, process specific hardware and software (such as manufacturing machines or robots), the data semantics of the application (for example manufacturing data or maintenance data), messaging, key performance indicators, and more.

Due to this large scope of two major categories – generally and domain specific – and many sub-categories, standards with relevance for digital twins stem from many standardisation bodies. There is not one standard for digital twin, there are rather hundreds, and there is not one responsible standardisation body, rather ten. Therefore, it is difficult to find one’s way through the huge amount of standard related information. Below, we introduce some major standardisation bodies – we focus on the international ones, although also some national ones are listed; most of the standards mentioned in this document originate from the organizations listed below.

Key standardisation bodies or organizations with relevance to digital twins:

-	 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an independent, non-governmental international organization consisting of 165 national standards bodies. It unites experts for the sake of sharing knowledge and to develop voluntary, consensus-based, market relevant standards to support innovation and provide solutions to global challenges, like using digital twins to ensure smart production and system operation in smart industry context. ISO is developing standards in all domains that are not covered by IEC. ISO and IEC harmonize their activities closely, currently especially in the areas of smart manufacturing and digital twins.

-	International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is similarly structured and also a well-attended international standardisation organization as ISO. IEC publishes international standards for all electrical, electronic and related technologies. IEC standards include energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and electromagnetics, electroacoustics, multimedia, telecommunication and medical technology, as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility, measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment.

-	European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) are private international non-profit standardisation organizations controlled by 34 national members. They consider themselves as “business catalysts in Europe, removing trade barriers for European industry and consumers. Their mission is to foster the European economy in global trading, the welfare of European citizens and the environment. Through their services they provide platforms for the development of European Standards and other technical specs.” CEN and CENELEC cooperate with their international “sister” organizations ISO and IEC for global standards to facilitate international trade. In distinction from ISO and IEC, CEN and CENELEC work closely with the European Commission to develop standards that correspond with relevant EU legislation (“Harmonised Standards”). Digital twin related contributions seem to be focused on product maintenance processes.

- European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) is the third European Standards Organization that is officially recognized by the EU and may, thus, provide “Harmonised Standards”. ETSI supports else the development and testing of global information and communications technology (ICT) standards across all sectors of industry and society. ETSI is an independent, not-for-profit, membership-based standardisation organization. In this survey, we have not met specifically digital twin related material by ETSI.

-	 European Space Agency (ESA) “has a strong commitment to support the European Cooperation for Space Standardisation (ECSS), an initiative established to develop a coherent, single set of user-friendly standards for all European space activities”[2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1). ECSS documents have controlled the lifecycle of space systems for a long time, and they are involved in one of the Change2Twin pilots. Thus, digital twin solutions will need to take those standards into account, and ECSS standards will change to accommodate digital twins for the space industry.

-	American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is an international standards organization consisting of individual and organizational members that publishes standards for a wide range of materials, products, processes and services. ASTM operates over 12,000 voluntary consensus standards globally. In relation to digital twins, ASTM standards may provide the semantics of aspects of a product, such as geometric dimensions and tolerances.

-	World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international membership organization of individuals and organizations that “develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web”[3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.2s8eyo1). Examples of W3C standards include HTML, XML, URI, RDF, OWL, SOAP and SPARQL. Several W3C standards are also published as ISO standards. W3C standards play an important role in digital twin solutions.

-	 Object Management Group (OMG) is a not-for-profit standards consortium founded in 1989. Vendors, end-users, academic institutions and government agencies develop internationally enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and industries. For digital twins highly relevant consortia currently include the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC), with over 250 members and formed to accelerate development, adoption and widespread use of interconnected machines and devices and intelligent analytics. More recently, a sister consortium of the IIC, called the Digital Twin Consortium (DTC), coalesces industry, government and academia to drive towards consistent vocabulary, architecture, security, and interoperability of digital twin technology. Key industries of theirs include manufacturing, and aerospace & defense.

-	 Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) is a global not-for-profit membership-based consortium that works on the development, convergence and adoption of open standards for cybersecurity, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT), emergency management, cloud computing, legal data exchange, energy, content technologies, and other areas. Although the topics sound relevant for the context at hand, this survey could not identify a specific interest in OASIS deliverables.

-	 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is a professional association dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity. With nearly 1300 standards and projects under development, IEEE develops industry standards in a broad range of technologies that drive functionality, capabilities, and interoperability of products and services, transforming industries, like smart industry, and are critical to advanced digitization trends like the digital twin.

-	Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC): SPEC is a non-profit corporation that aims to establish, maintain and endorse standardized benchmarks and tools that evaluate performance and energy efficiency for the newest generation of computing systems. This is essential, especially for the storage, processing and transportation of data using systems like cloud computing, edge computing, and High Performance Computing (HPC) used by smart industry digital twin solutions.

-	Verband Deutscher Maschinen- und Anlagenbau (VDMA) is the German Mechanical Engineering Industrial Association. VDMA is one of the key association service providers in Europe and offers the largest engineering industry network in Europe. VDMA represents the entire process - from the component to the system, to the system suppliers on the system integrator and to service providers. VDMA integrates sector-specific developments around Industry 4.0 and has an active role in the development of Industry 4.0 standards under the umbrella of the NAM (DIN department for mechanical engineering).

-	 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) is a consortium of industrial partners working to define a 3D printing format that "will allow design applications to send full-fidelity 3D models to a mix of other applications, platforms, services and printers"[4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.17dp8vu). The consortium consists of partners representing CAD industry as well as 3D printing vendors and technology companies. 3MF, thus, provides one of the many interoperability formats that are so important in cost-efficient digital twin solutions.

## 4 RELATED STANDARDS SURVEYS

Many resources are available to express the digital twin example studies or implementations, tools, or views of academics and companies [[RD7\], ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)like Deloitte [[RD8\]. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)Particularly, a standardized framework would provide a means to manage the large and quite complex set of standards, technologies, and processes involved in such an implementation. Although the importance of standards for data and connectivity are highlighted in Deloitte’s conceptual architecture, no explicit reference is provided. However, they do form a fundamental part of the manufacturing digital twin.

Especially ISO and IEC have recognized the need of frameworks of standards, not only to help those who want to apply standards, but also to better coordinate the work of the many standards committees. Standards that serve a common industrial purpose are collected and their contributions categorized. A terminology is established to make this possible. Current focus is manufacturing under the headings of “Smart manufacturing” and “Digital twins for manufacturing” and the most prominent representatives of this class of standards are the following ones that are listed with increasing applicability to Change2Twin:

- ISO/TR 23087:2018 - Automation systems and integration — The Big Picture of standards o Aims at monitoring the consistency of published standards and current or future standardisation projects for manufacturing in general. -	ISO/IEC 63306 - Smart manufacturing standards map

  - Part 1 - Framework (2020): Describes the framework and the vocabulary that are used for the development of entries in the Smart Manufacturing Standards Map Catalogue. These enable the mapping and linking of standards and standard projects related to various aspects of smart manufacturing (product, production, supply chain, industrial services ...).

  - Part 2 - Catalogue (under development)

-	ISO 23247 Digital Twin manufacturing framework
  - Part 1 to Part 4 (under development): A framework to support the creation of digital twins of observable manufacturing elements including personnel, equipment, materials, manufacturing processes, facilities, environment, products, and supporting documents.

Whereas it is good news that existing and future manufacturing standards will be better harmonized and accessible, the work is tedious and time consuming. Of the three initiatives listed above, we consider ISO 23247 to be the most supportive one for immediate implementations and the Change2Twin platform.

Besides these overviews that are initiated by standardisation bodies themselves, standards surveys have been published or are still in work by industrial groups and projects. We have studied a selection of those driven by the wish to reuse relevant results. Thus, we were able to start our survey of standards that Change2Twin partners consider relevant, which is summarized in Chapter [5, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.1y810tw)with an existing list of applicable standards. As a result of this survey, we want to extend the most comprehensive survey by Change2Twin identified standards; see [Appendix A.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0)

The following [Table 2 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3rdcrjn)includes the sources that we have consulted. Each source references many standards and is further discussed in the chapter reference in the rightmost column.

### 4.2 EFPF STANDARDS

The European Connected Factory Platform for Agile Manufacturing (EFPF) is an EU H2020 funded Factory of the Future project. Its goal is to grow an ecosystem that enables the transition from “analog” mass production to “digital twins” and “lot-size-one” manufacturing using solutions from Industry 4.0, IoT, AI, Big Data and Digital Manufacturing domains. In 2019, they published a standardisation plan [[RD1\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)that assigns relevant standardisation bodies and standards to categories of industrial use.

### 4.3 ZERO DEFECTS MANUFACTURING PLATFORM (ZDMP)

The EU H2020 Factory of the Future project Zero Defects Manufacturing Platform (ZDMP) aims to establish and develop by the end of 2022 a digital platform for connected smart factories for achieving excellence in manufacturing through zero-defect processes and products.

Mid 2020 the project prepared an overview of standardisation bodies and standards with relevance for, among others, smart manufacturing and predictive maintenance, see [[RD2\]. ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)Change2Twin enabling technologies and pilots focus mainly on these two use cases. Therefore, we below summarize the overviews of Chapters 1.2.3 and 1.2.5 of [[RD2\].](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)

[[RD2\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)Chapter 1.2.3:

“One of the most important aspects in smart manufacturing is the interoperability between the various types of machines, sensors, and devices. Unified connections between them and the overall semantics can be seen as enabler for smart manufacturing and as one of the main tasks of standardisation.

The most important standards to ensure interoperability are perceived to be:

-	OPC UA (IEC 62541 series) – OPC Unified Architectures OPC UA Open Platform Communications United Architecture Series of standards, developed by the OPC foundation

-	W3C World Wide Web Consortium standards HTML, XHTML, XML, RDF, OWL, CSS, SVG

-	 MQTT (ISO/IEC 20922:2016) – Information technology – Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) v3.1.1 Message Queuing Telemetry Transport is a publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol

-	ETSI TS 118112 V 2.0.0:2016 – oneM2M – Base Ontology Contains the specification of the oneM2M base ontology”

[[RD2\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)Chapter 1.2.5:

“Maintenance is a topic which is well established in standardisation. Nevertheless, maintenance is experiencing substantial changes in connection with smart manufacturing. Reactive and periodic preventative maintenance strategies are increasingly being replaced by predictive ones. In the future, smart, interconnected factories will identify a large proportion of their faults before they occur. This will be enabled by different condition monitoring technologies so that a wide range of data related to a plant will be captured and analysed.

Most relevant basic standards are:

-	 EN 13306:2017 – Maintenance – Maintenance terminology Uniform definitions of the concepts underlying all types of maintenance and maintenance management have already been formulated in EN 13306:2018-02, irrespective of the objects or maintenance stakeholders involved.

-	 EN 17007:2017 – Maintenance process and associated indicators A detailed specification of the essential processes that form part of an overarching maintenance organisation and the associated reciprocal relationships can be found in EN 17007:2017, thereby ensuring that all entities involved in maintenance share the same understanding of the process.”

[[RD2\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)includes also, in its Figure 6, “Most important standards in ZDMP”, a top 20 list of standards that resulted from a survey among project partners responsible for architecture components. This list is not included here because, ZDMP contributes to the more comprehensive efforts of the Digital Manufacturing Platforms (DMP) cluster (see Chapter [4.5, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.z337ya)below). Thus, the ZDMP identified standards are included in the listing of [Appendix A.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0)

### 4.4 INDUSTRY 4.0 STANDARDS OVERVIEW BY FRAUNHOFER IAIS

[[RD4\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)provides a webpage that classifies a set of standards by topics and relates them to the Industry 4.0 framework RAMI 4.0 by an interactive graphical representation. This representation is not as complete as some of the other standards surveys in this document, but the way of presenting the standards is user-friendly and may be considered for future Change2Twin T1.5 deliverables; see [Figure 1, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.z337ya)below.

Updated information and alternative ways of representation are available from the following GitHub page that is referenced by [[RD4\]:](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)

https://i40-tools.github.io/StandardOntologyVisualization/

This updated web presentation is a valuable source of information and a good entry point to the standards listed. The presented information, however, needs a thorough quality review.

Therefore, this source of input has not been and will not be further pursued by T1.5 except for its user-friendly layout.

### 4.5 DIGITAL MANUFACTURING PLATFORMS CLUSTER

The DMP cluster [[RD6\] ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)is composed of six projects funded by EU R&D funds through the DT-ICT-07 calls in 2018 and 2019. The DMP cluster is pursuing joint activities in several areas (platform interoperability, dissemination, business models, standardisation, etc.) to synchronise related activities that take place in the different projects. For details, see [https://www.efpf.org/event/DMP-Cluster-Meeting ](https://www.efpf.org/event/DMP-Cluster-Meeting).

The European Factories of the Future Research Association (EFFRA) is a non-for-profit, industry-driven association promoting the development of new and innovative production technologies. It is the official representative of the private side in the 'Factories of the Future' public-private partnership. For details, see [https://www.effra.eu/ ](https://www.effra.eu/).

With contributions by various organizations, EFFRA has prepared a table, see [[RD3\], ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.vx1227)that is on the one hand an overview of standards and on the other hand a mapping of those standards to the concepts of the Industry 4.0 architecture RAMI 4.0. The table is still work in progress.

This is the most comprehensive overview of standards with relevance for the Change2Twin world of discourse. The T1.5 team has, therefore, attached it to the standards survey among the Change2Twin partners. Partners could either just mark listed standards as relevant or add missing standards to the list.

The survey result is documented in an excerpt of the original DMP table in [Appendix A ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0)that has been adapted for this purpose. In [Table 5 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0)in the appendix, Change2Twin partners have indicated their interests in the listed standards in the third column, called “C2T partner(s)”. Standards that were not yet in the original DMP table have been added in the subsequent [Table 6.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3hv69ve)

In this column 3, the acronym of interested Change2Twin partners is followed by a letter in parentheses; this letter indicates the level of partner involvement as follows:

- U: using the standard,
- M: monitoring the development of the standard, and
- D: developing the standard, that is, contributing to the work of the standardisation body in maintaining the standard.

For each Change2Twin entry in [Table 5 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3fwokq0)and [Table 6, ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.3hv69ve)the respective Change2Twin partner added a sub-chapter to Chapter [5 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.1y810tw)including details of the role of the standard in the project.

Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) 2016-06 - v3.1.1

iso.org; ISO/IEC JTC 1 Information Technology http://mqtt.org/documentation

Open standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things https://mqtt.org/use-cases/

It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

The design principles aim at minimizing network bandwidth and device resource requirements whilst also attempting to ensure reliability and some degree of assurance of delivery. These principles also turn out to make the protocol ideal of the emerging machine-to-machine (M2M) or Internet of Things world of connected devices, and for mobile applications where bandwidth and battery power are at a premium.

MQTT defines three Quality of Service (QoS) levels to satisfy the different requirements of data delivery:

-	QoS 0 - represents a best effort message delivery and does not guarantee that the message reaches the destination.

-	QoS 1 - guarantees that the sent messages arrive at subscriber nodes at least once, but possible repetitions can happen.

-	QoS 2 - guarantees that the messages are delivered to the subscriber nodes only once.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others.

Time sensitive networking

[Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group | (ieee802.org)](https://1.ieee802.org/tsn/#:~:text=Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is a set of standards,part of the IEEE 802.1 Working Group (WG).) https://www.techstreet.com/ieee

Deterministic communication Communication of critical information

Ensuring bounded latency, low packet loss and delay variation Industrial machines and plants today use specialized fieldbuses that are

incompatible with each another and set strict requirements for networks in order to help achieve the necessary communication guarantees for applications. The advent of Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) now means that industrial communication can standardize on Ethernet in the same way that enterprise IT has done.

TSN provides benefits to industrial automation by providing network services that include:

•	bounded latency guaranties, •	reliable delivery of data,

•	increased availability of network services for end-devices,

•	easy integration of innovations from open networks (more bandwidth, reliability and options), and

•	ability to converge applications and traffic on a single, open network.

TSN adds a range of functions and capabilities to Ethernet to make it more applicable to industrial applications that require more deterministic characteristics than possible in previous Ethernet implementations.

TTTech: Extend OPC UA over TSN

By using open and standard technologies like OPC UA and TSN in combination, SMEs can avoid the danger that fieldbus providers simply add new layers of proprietary technology on top of TSN (vendor lock-in).

Real-time monitoring of machine/devices (Anomaly detection, Predictive Maintenance, Asset performance management/Operations optimisation)

IEEE 802.1AS is being developed in the 802.1 working group as part of a set of standards for audio/video bridging (AVB).

This standard specifies the protocol and procedures used to ensure that the synchronization requirements are met for time-sensitive applications, such as audio, video, and time-sensitive control, across networks; for example, IEEE 802 and similar media.

This includes the maintenance of synchronized time during normal operation and following addition, removal, or failure of network components and network reconfiguration.

It specifies the use of IEEE 1588 standard specifications where applicable in the context of IEEE Std 802.1Q. Synchronization to an externally provided timing signal (e.g., a recognized timing standard such as UTC or TAI) is not part of this standard but is not precluded.

### 5.32 OPC 10000-14 - PART 14: PUB/SUB

Name Version Availability Category Use case

In scope

OPC UA PubSub (UDP/IP and MQTT) 2018-02-16 Release 1.04

OPC Foundation; https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/Core/docs/Part14/ Extension of OPC UA over Internet (WAN)

Enabling secure end-to-end data exchange in highly scalable cloud-based applications

OPC UA PubSub defines an OPC UA publish-subscribe communication model which complements the client-server pattern already existing.

PubSub allows distributing data and events from an OPC UA information source to interested observers. It enables the integration of OPC UA in two important ways. The first is at shop floor level where low power and low-latency communications on local networks are required. The second application is the integration of OPC UA in scalable cloud-based applications.

In PubSub the participating OPC UA Applications with their roles as Publishers and Subscribers are decoupled. The number of Subscribers receiving data from a Publisher does not influence the Publisher. This makes PubSub suitable for applications where location independence and scalability are required.

OPC UA Part 14 defines a Pub/Sub architecture for both LAN and WAN based communications. The difference between the two is what type of transport is used since there are different challenges to overcome in different environments:

•	for lateral connectivity (subnets, LANs): UDP

•	for vertical connectivity (cloud environments, WANs): MQTT or AMQP

#### OPC UA PubSub UDP

OPC UA PubSub enables use of the User Data Protocol (UDP) as transporting protocol for establishing low-latency, loss tolerating connections on LANs.

OPC UA UDP is used to transport UADP NetworkMessages. For OPC UA UDP it is recommended to limit the MaxNetworkMessageSize plus additional headers to an MTU size. The number of frames used for a UADP NetworkMessage influences the probability that UADP NetworkMessages get lost.

OPC UA PubSub with UDP is a solution that fits the needs of complex automation set-ups and can be integrated across all OT layers and embedded systems. UDP creates a low amount of overhead since error checking and processing are not performed at the level of the network interface but can be executed in the application. Thus e.g. if a package is missing there is no delay due to waiting for a correction.

Hence the combination of OPC UA PubSub and UDP is well suited for use in TSN networks and devices with constrained resources like sensor nodes and low-power processors.

#### OPC UA PubSub MQTT

The Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is an open standard application layer protocol for Message Oriented Middleware. MQTT is often used with a Broker that relays messages between applications that cannot communicate directly.

Publishers send MQTT messages to MQTT brokers. Subscribers subscribe to MQTT brokers for messages. A Broker may persist messages so they can be delivered even if the subscriber is not online. Brokers may also allow messages to be sent to multiple Subscribers.

The MQTT protocol defines a binary protocol used to send and receive messages from and to topics. The body is a binary file that can contain any data serialized using an encoding chosen by the application. The specification defines two possible encodings for the message body: the binary encoded DataSetMessage and a JSON encoded DataSetMessage. MQTT does not provide a mechanism for specifying the encoding of the MQTT message which means the Subscribers shall be configured in advance with knowledge of the expected encoding. Publishers should only publish NetworkMessages using a single encoding to a unique MQTT topic name.

C2T contributions SME issues

MQTT is typically suited for IT/OT integrations as well as cloud based applications. The messaging protocol is extremely simple and lightweight. Therefore, MQTT is a good fit for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks without deterministic requirements. Another advantage of MQTT is that it is supported by several industry heavyweights like Microsoft as the company’s Azure IoT Hub natively supports communication over the MQTT, AMQP, and HTTP protocols.

With the Companion Specifications, the OPC Foundation has created the possibility to define special information models for OPC UA. To date, the specifications for robotics, machine tools and CNC systems, among others, have been published. Further information models are in draft status. The Companion Specification OPC UA for Machinery is currently available in a draft version from the VDMA. It plays a special role within the information models.

Machine components are defined in Building Blocks for Machinery in order to ultimately be able to represent entire machines.

The goal of the VDMA and the OPC Foundation is not a single information model that can map all machines, but a generalised concepts that allow individual machines to be composed of building blocks and described more precisely using the Companion Specifications. In summary, the goals of OPC UA for Machinery are the harmonisation of information models in mechanical and plant engineering and the definition of information building blocks for modelling machines and plants.

## 6	CONCLUSIONS

In this report, we described standards with relevance for digital twins in the smart industry context. We used internal and external sources to collect and categorize these standards. By a survey among Change2Twin partners, we identified 33 standards of particular interest, namely the usage of the standards in digital twin implementations. In some cases, project partners aim to further develop the standards. [Table 4 ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-cILDKHZ6DqKbZAfK1vvgfgZ2Vg2M-EO/edit#heading=h.41mghml)is a summary of current C2T partner involvements with these standards.

Deliverable 1.5 “Second report on standards relevant for digital twins” is the next deliverable of Change2Twin Task 1.5 and is due in May 2022.

This report will support the following activities:

- Validate the identified standards for their use in existing pilots and the emerging open-call experiments;
- Monitor the developments of the identified standards in their respective standardisation bodies including the contributions by Change2Twin partners;
- Evaluate recommendations concerning competing standards, such as, MQTT and OMG DDS; ∙   Convince the DMP Cluster to include the Change2Twin identified standards in their standards overview;
- Prepare a user-friendly best practice guide to the most important standards that accelerate digital twin implementations for SMEs (coordinate with WP6);
- Perform the SME compatibility test for the identified standards. Change2Twin focusses on SMEs, also with respect to their access to relevant standards. Small Business Standards (SBS) is a European non-profit association co-financed by the European Commission and EFTA Member States to represent and defend small and medium-sized enterprises’ interests in the standardisation process at European and international levels. SBS has developed a test that evaluates the SME friendliness of standards:
  - For the test, see [https://www.sbs-sme.eu/sme-compatibility-test-standards ](https://www.sbs-sme.eu/sme-compatibility-test-standards).
- Ensure that standards compliance is a selection criterion for enabling technologies in the marketplace listings; coordinate with WP2 and with the D1.3 editing team.
